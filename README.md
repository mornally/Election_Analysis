## Election-Audit Summary
Although this audit was conducted for this election specifically, the Python script could easily be repurposed for another election audit. Some modifications that may need to occur to repurpose this script might involve changing the way the file with the raw results are read in case they are in a different format, or modifying the looping conditions.
